# Machine-Learning-Scratch
# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a simple neural network framework from scratch in Python, designed for educational purposes and experimentation. It does not rely on external deep learning libraries, providing a clear view of the underlying mechanics of neural networks.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — Entry point for running and testing the neural network.
- `src/activation.py` — Contains activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU, etc.).
- `src/layers.py` — Implements neural network layers and their forward/backward passes.
- `src/loss.py` — Defines loss functions used for training.
- `src/trainer.py` — Handles the training loop, including forward, backward propagation, and parameter updates.
- `requirements.txt` — Lists required Python packages (minimal dependencies).

## Features
- Modular design for easy extension and experimentation.
- Customizable activation and loss functions.
- Manual implementation of forward and backward propagation.
- Simple training loop for supervised learning tasks.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
	```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```
2. Run the main script:
	```bash
	python main.py
	```
